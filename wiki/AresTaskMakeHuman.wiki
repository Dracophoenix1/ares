#summary MakeHuman specific tasks

[http://www.makehuman.org/ MakeHuman] will be used in order to get access to a huge panel
of morph targets for the different parts of the human body, allowing a
complete in-game customization of the characters.

= CS import plugin =

A first task would be to write a CS plugin that would read the data used by the !MakeHuman software, and convert it on the fly into a CS animesh.

Some features requested/desired:
 * import of the vertices, triangles, weight map and skeleton of the !MakeHuman model
 * adaptation of the animesh's skeleton to the size of the model
 * blending of the skin textures (through procedural textures?) and import of the materials/shaders
 * the animeshes have an optimization of the morph system using a subdivision of the vertices. This subdivision should probably be made here in some preprocessing of the !MakeHuman model, or using the !MakeHuman vertex groups.
 * import of the clothes
 * threaded loading of the morph targets, clothes and other data
 * cache of render buffers and textures, shared among all active characters
 * subdivision of the !MakeHuman model, in order to deactivate the parts of the body that are hidden by the clothes
 * import from the !MakeHuman hair system to the CS one
 * LOD management using the !MakeHuman proxies as submeshes that are enabled/disabled depending on the LOD
