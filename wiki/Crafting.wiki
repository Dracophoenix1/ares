#summary Crafting in Ares, making of tools and weapons

= Introduction =

In Ares it will be possible to make new tools, weapon and armor using various technology items that you can find. You will be able to do the following:

 * Dismantle human and alien devices (provided you have the right tools) to get the parts.
 * Assemble parts again into various configurations (again provided you have the right tools).
 * Fix existing devices using replacement parts.
