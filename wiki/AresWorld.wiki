#summary Geography of the world in Ares

= Introduction =

Ares takes place on earth in the year 2033. So the general style should be contemporary and slightly futuristic. Also note that there is alien technology and alien spaceships.

= Levels =

 * [StoryLevelCamp Training Camp]: The first level would be the training camp where our hero is trained as a soldier. The training is nearing its end and with a few minigames the player can choose his or her attributes. There should be a few training areas in this level and the possibility to interact with some NPC's. Some of them might give clues useful for future quest lines (i.e. there could be a spy in the camp although you wouldn't know that at first).
 * [StoryLevelOostende Oostende]: near the camp there is a small city (since I'm from Belgium I thought to pick a coastal city near the Belgian coastline, any place in Europe is just as good as any since this is a global problem, so why not there?).
 * [StoryLevelAirportOostende]: Oostende has an airport which has been mostly rebuild after the war as a military airport. There is one section where spaceships can launch.
