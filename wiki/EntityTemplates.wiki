#summary Entity templates

= Introduction =

Entity templates are blue-prints for creating entities. They are a very important thing in CEL and Ares because most property classes and plugins (like the [PCInventory inventory], the [LootGenerator loot generator], the [PCSpawn spawning property class], the [DynWorld dynamic world plugin], ...) work with entity templates from which they will create the actual entities.
