This latest video is a remake of my old AresEd video. It is made using better technology (no more video camera of my laptop screen) and shows a few new features (moving foliage/grass and some editing improvements). <g:plusone size="medium"></g:plusone>

This video is more technical and demonstrates how CEL supports lots of entities (about 10 million) with clever bookkeeping and managing of (modified) state. <g:plusone size="medium"></g:plusone>

In this video we demonstrate the basic functionality of the AresEd game editor. This is obviously work in progress and the video was also made using a video camera. So not very high quality. <g:plusone size="medium"></g:plusone>
