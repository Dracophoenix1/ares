#summary Art Pipeline

= Introduction =

If you are an artist then this page is for you. In addition to the information here you can find general Crystal Space related information [http://www.crystalspace3d.org/main/Creating_Art on this page].


= Static Models =

The easiest way to make static models is using [http://www.blender3d.org Blender]. The reason is that we have very good support for exporting Blender models to Crystal Space format.

If you use Blender 2.49 (or Blender < 2.5) then you should use [http://leapingcat.org/blender2crystal/index.php/Main_Page blender2crystal]. This tool is very powerful and has a lot of support for Crystal Space features.

for Blender 2.5 there is a [http://wiki.peragro.org/index.php/Tools/B2.5CS new exporter] available. It is not yet as powerful as the original blender2crystal but it does the job.

= Animated Meshes =

= Textures =

You can make textures in any kind of image editor. [http://www.gimp.org/ GIMP] is a good choice if you want a powerful and free Open Source image editor.

= Sound =

For small sound effects we support WAV files. Music is typically done with OGG files. Crystal Space does *not* support MP3.
