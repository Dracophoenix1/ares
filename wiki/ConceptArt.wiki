#summary A collection of concept art for Ares

= Wanted =

Here is a list of concept art that we need (incomplete list):

 * Spaceship section of the airport. This needs to be a ground-based spaceship section where relatively big spaceships can land and take off. I imagine this to be a deep pit of about 1 square km. The walls of the pit should have a highly technological feel to them. The spaceships are standing inside the pit with walkways extended so that the crew can get on them.
 * Military base annoy 2033.
 * Destroyed section of Oostende.
 * Aliens. The aliens should look alien (duh!) and fearsome but nevertheless it should be possible to imagine a diplomatic solution with them. Perhaps we can even have multiple classes of aliens. Imagine that the aliens are actually different species where the main race (the 'boss/intelligent' race) doesn't do a lot of fighting but perhaps they employ other races to do that.
 * Various human armor (anno 2033) and weapons.
 * Various alien armor and weapons.
 * Various hybrid armor and weapons (mixed technology, may look a little bit crude because it was made with limited resources).
