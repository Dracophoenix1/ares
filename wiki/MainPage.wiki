#summary Main page for Ares Information.

= Introduction =

The goal of Project Ares is to make three things:

 * AresEd: A world editor specific for Ares (can't be used as a generic world editor for other CS apps) in which you can make a game world and define the game logic.
 * A game player that can play games created by the editor.
 * An actual [AresGame game] that uses this technology.
